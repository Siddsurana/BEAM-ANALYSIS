# Beam Analysis Project

A comprehensive web-based beam analysis tool developed by student of JSPM's RSCOE (Rajarshi Shahu College of Engineering) for analyzing different types of beam loading scenarios in structural engineering.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project provides an interactive web application for performing structural analysis on beams subjected to different types of loads:
- **Point Load Analysis** - Single concentrated force on a beam
- **UDL (Uniformly Distributed Load) Analysis** - Load distributed uniformly across the beam length
- **UVL (Uniformly Varying Load) Analysis** - Load varying linearly across the beam length

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Beam Visualization**: Real-time SVG diagrams showing beam configurations
- **Multiple Load Types**: Support for Point Load, UDL, and UVL analysis
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with dark theme and mobile-friendly interface
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant computation of beam reactions and forces
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for students learning structural analysis concepts

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Icons**: Ionicons, Font Awesome
- **Graphics**: SVG for beam diagrams
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional software installation required

### Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** the project files
2. **Open** `index.html` in your web browser
3. **Navigate** to the desired analysis type from the main menu

### Alternative Setup (Local Server)
For better performance, you can run the project on a local server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Point Load Analysis
- Navigate to "Point Load" from the main menu
- Enter the beam length (in meters)
- Enter the point load magnitude (in Newtons)
- Click "Calculate" to see results
- View the interactive beam diagram

### 2. UDL (Uniformly Distributed Load) Analysis
- Navigate to "UDL" from the main menu
- Enter the beam length (in meters)
